You'd like to write about past work slowdowns that have caused garbage to pile up in the street, streets to not be swept, etc, and compare them to the current slowdown. You've also heard rumors that it was worse in Staten Island and a few Brooklyn neighborhoods - Marine Park and Canarsie - than everywhere else.\n",
